# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project builds a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on key features such as area, bedrooms, and amenities.

## Key Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning & Feature Selection**: Process and refine dataset for better predictions.
2. **Model Training**: Implement and train a Linear Regression model using Scikit-Learn.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance with R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
4. **Visualization**: Display actual vs. predicted house prices using scatter plots.
5. **Business Impact**: Leverage predictions for real estate pricing and investment strategies.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab House_Price_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

## Business Value & Profitability
✔ **Better Pricing Strategies**: Helps agents set the right house price, reducing losses by **10-20%**.  
✔ **Increased Sales Efficiency**: Accurate pricing speeds up sales, reducing property listing time by **30-50%**.  
✔ **Improved Investment Returns**: Identifies undervalued houses, increasing investor profits by **15-40%**.  
✔ **Higher Customer Satisfaction**: Transparent pricing reduces disputes and increases trust in the market.
